 * to a CSV file.
 * It can be set with the names of the headers, the thousand and decimal separators, the value separator.
 * Otherwise, it prompts the user for those values.
 * In case this class is used with a GUI, those values should be set in the constructor or with accessor
 * functions before the class start writing the file.
