 * This class is tasked with reading the contents of a CSV file into a URLList.
 * It can receive the format, otherwise it will prompt the user to receive it.
 * It can be set with the presence of headers, thousand and decimal separators, value separator,
 * with the column numbers for the page impressions and the url. Otherwise, it prompts the user
 * for those values.
 * In case this class is used with a GUI, those values should be set in the constructor or with accessor
 * functions before the class start reading the file.
